A formally verified options hedging engine combining **Lean 4 theorem proving** with **Python numerical computing**.

Every portfolio state transition (every trade, every mark-to-market update, every option settlement) carries a machine-checked proof of correctness. The results are not merely tested; they are provably correct, with the proof attached.

## What the engine does

The engine is a **formally verified delta-hedging backtester**. It simulates discrete delta-hedging strategies over historical or synthetic price paths. A real-time hedging execution engine is in development.

At each weekly rebalancing step:

1. The option is marked to market at the new Black-Scholes price
2. The underlying hedge is rebalanced to the current delta
3. A `StepCertificate` is emitted verifying Lean's `valueUpdateFormula` held

A bug in the accounting logic raises `ValueError` immediately rather than silently producing incorrect numbers.

## Why formal proof?

A unit test checks one input. A Lean proof checks **all inputs**. The theorems in this engine hold for every possible portfolio, every possible trade size, every possible option strike and spot price.

The key theorem, `settlement_value_formula`, unifies ITM and OTM option expiry into a single machine-checked statement:

$$\Delta\text{PV} = \text{qty} \times (\text{payoff} - \text{mark})$$

This holds whether the option expires in-the-money (ITM, `applyTrade` path) or out-of-the-money (OTM, `abandonPosition` path).

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eigenq-xyz/verified-options-backtest
cd verified-options-backtest
make setup   # install Lean (elan) + Python (uv)
make test    # Lean proofs + Python tests
```
