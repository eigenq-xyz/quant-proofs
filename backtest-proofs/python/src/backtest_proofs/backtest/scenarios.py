"""Hardcoded deterministic price paths for backtest validation.

Hull "Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives" 9th Global ed.:

Table 19.2 — option closes IN the money (S_T=57.25 > K=50):
    Written 100,000 European calls; cost of hedging ~$263,300

Table 19.3 — option closes OUT of the money (S_T=48.12 < K=50):
    Written 100,000 European calls; cost of hedging ~$256,600

Both scenarios: S₀=49, K=50, r=5%, σ=20%, T=20 weeks (~0.3846 yr)

These paths are deterministic and independent of any simulator; the
backtest results are reproducible without a random seed.
