# Bridge: measure-theoretic adaptedness implies pointwise non-anticipation

`NoLookahead` states no-look-ahead **pointwise** (outcomes that agree on the observed
history up to `t` produce the same value at `t`); `Measurability` states it
**measure-theoretically** (the signal process is `Adapted` to the natural price
filtration, citing `ftap-proofs`). This module connects them in the forward direction.

What is proved: if a real process is `𝓕ₜ`-measurable against the natural filtration of the
price observations, then it cannot tell apart two outcomes whose price history agrees up to
`t`. This is a pointwise non-anticipation property at the level of outcomes `ω : Ω`: the same
content as `NoLookahead.NonAnticipating` specialized to a single scalar observation per time,
showing the measure-theoretic guarantee carries the elementary one. What is **not** proved
here: a general encoding lemma instantiating `NoLookahead.NonAnticipating` itself, which is
stated over the abstract multi-asset path space `Path Asset V → Time → Asset → W`; bridging
that type (with its asset dimension) to a measure-theoretic process is left as follow-up. The
reverse direction (pointwise dependence implies measurability) needs a Doob-Dynkin
factorization plus a measurable-dependence hypothesis and is also out of scope.

The key sublemma `agreeUpTo_indistinguishable` bounds the natural filtration above by
`indistinguishableSpace ω ω'`, the σ-algebra of events that cannot separate two
history-agreeing outcomes, reduced over the `⨆` to each price coordinate `s ≤ t`.

/-- Two outcomes agree on the price history through time `t`: every observation `price s`
with `s ≤ t` takes the same value on both. This is the outcome-level rendering of
`ResearchPipeline.AgreeUpTo`, specialized to a single scalar observation per time (the path's
asset dimension is dropped; the momentum signal is single-asset). -/

/-- **History-agreeing outcomes are indistinguishable by any `𝓕ₜ` event.** If `ω` and `ω'`
share the price history up to `t`, then they lie in exactly the same sets of the natural
filtration at time `t`. It suffices to show the natural filtration at `t` is no finer than
`indistinguishableSpace ω ω'`, which reduces over the `⨆` to each price coordinate `s ≤ t`,
where `price s ω = price s ω'` makes every preimage non-separating. -/
